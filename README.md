# PDF Outline Extractor – Challenge 1A | Adobe India Hackathon

This repository contains a robust solution for **Challenge 1A** of the Adobe India Hackathon:  
**Extracting structured outlines from PDF files (Title, H1, H2, H3) in under 10 seconds**.

---

## Problem Statement

PDFs are designed for humans — not machines. Our task is to **extract a hierarchical outline** from a PDF file (up to 50 pages), including:

- Document Title  
- Headings: H1, H2, H3  
- Page numbers for each heading  

This outline will serve as the backbone for advanced use-cases such as semantic search and document understanding.

---

## Constraints

-  Must execute within **10 seconds** for a 50-page PDF  
-  No internet access or API calls allowed  
-  Must run on **CPU-only** (amd64), on a system with **8 CPUs and 16GB RAM**  
-  Model size (if any) must be **≤ 200MB**  
-  Generalize across simple and complex PDFs  
-  No hardcoded rules per file — must be content-agnostic  

---

## Approach

1. **PDF Parsing** – Using [PyMuPDF (fitz)] to extract text, font properties, and structure.
2. **Heading Detection** – Based on:
   - Font size clusters
   - Font weight/style
   - Positional hierarchy
   - Smart filtering of repetitive elements
3. **Title Detection** – From the first page using largest unique text, semantic cues.
4. **Hierarchical Structuring** – Classifying heading levels into H1, H2, H3 using learned patterns and font hierarchy.
5. **Output Formatting** – Clean, standardized JSON output matching spec.
